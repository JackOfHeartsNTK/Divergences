FINISHED:
-Papal States can take Palestine from the Turks and create Oltremare (Kingdom of Jerusalem) after conquering all the North Italian minors that are not in anyone's sphere at the 1836 start date.  
-Oltremare gets a bunch of decisions to core the Arabian peninsula, Kurdistan, Assyria, Armenian Cilicia, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon & Egypt, as well as high infamy decisions to assimilate the Misri, Bedouin, Mashriqi, Turkish and Kurdish populations in these areas to their local Christian minority. 
-Papal States and Oltremare can not form Italy
-Holy Britannian Empire can accept Lotharian culture as well as gain cores on the Spanish Amerigan states. Also, forming HBE removes all Beornia cores (to prevent lost great war dismantlement bug where Beornia is released and controls everything except OTL buenos aires which is left to the defeated HBE)
-Holy Roman Empire can gain cores on various other German minority states it conquers (such as Poznan, Lorraine, Luxembourg and Schleswig)
-Unique Inventions that have 0% chance of being discovered by anyone except the specified nations. Papal States and Oltremare get the Holy Hand Grenade (2 siege damage given to all non engineer infantry) while Holy Britannian Empire gets the Knightmare Frame (2 maneuver, 2 attack, and 2 speed given to tanks)
-Taiping can no longer form China. Instead, they can use Chinese Reunification CB to take all of China normally then take a decision which spreads their cores all over China and removes all Chinese cores ( to facilitate mass conversion of the Buddhist and Hindu majority to the Taiping Christianity ). Taiping also gain decisions to core Vietnam and Korea and "deal" with the Manchus as well as annex Uighur, Oirat and Mongol puppets/spherelings.
Ungern Romanov as the prime minister of a modernized Dzungar Khanate/Turania now gives a 0.2 prestige boost and -0.1 infamy reduction
